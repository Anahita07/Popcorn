I really like popcorn its a really light and tasty and easy to make.
When it's air-popped and lightly seasoned, popcorn is an efficiently healthy snack.
 That's because it is a whole grain, and high-fiber whole grains have been linked to a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, some cancers and other health problems.
 but keep in mind thats its still not good to eat it everyday.
 its healthy too so thats the BEST part!
there is also another way to make popcorn that is to buy the premade popcorn packets from the market.
but keep in mind that premade popcorn often contains a high level of salt, or sodium. 
Eating too much sodium can cause high blood pressure and lead to other health complications.
Some brands also include a lot of sugar. Added butter, sugar, and salt can make popcorn an unhealthful snack.
